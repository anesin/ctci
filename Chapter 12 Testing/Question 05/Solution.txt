To understand the constraints, you should ask a lot of questions to understand the "who, what, where, when, how and why" of a problem (or as many of those as apply to the problem). Now that you understand what you're testing, the key here is structure. Consider what the different components of the object or problem, and go from there. In this case, the components might be; fact check, intended use, intended use, safety, unintended uses.

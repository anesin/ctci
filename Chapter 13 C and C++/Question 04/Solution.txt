Shallow copies duplicate as little as possible. A shallow copy of a collection is a copy of the collection structure, not the elements. With a shallow copy, two collections now share the individual elements.

vector<int> data(1, 100);
vector<int> &shallow = data;


Deep copies duplicate everything. A deep copy of a collection is two collections with all of the elements in the original collection duplicated.

vector<int> data(1, 100);
vector<int> deep(data.begin(), data.end());

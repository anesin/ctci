The probablity of winnig the game #1:
    p

The probablity of winnig the game #2:
    the probablity of making two of three shots + the probablity of making all of three shots
    = (p*p*(1-p))*3 + p*p*p
    = 3p² - 2p³

Thus, when the game #1 have an advantage:
    the probablity of winning the game #1 > the probablity of winning the game #2
                                        p > 3p² - 2p³
                            2p² - 3p + 1 > 0
                          (2p - 1)(p - 1) > 0
therefore
    ½ < p < 1

On the contrary to this, when the game #2 have it over:
    0 < p < ½
because, p must be 0 ≤ p ≤ 1.

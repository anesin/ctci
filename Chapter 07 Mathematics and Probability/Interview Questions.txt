7.1 You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

7.2 There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.
Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

7.3 Given two lines on a Cartesian plane, determine whether the two lines would intersect.

7.4 Write methods to implement the multiply, subtract, and divide operations for integers. Use only the add operator.

7.5 Given two squares on a two-dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two squares in half. Assume that the top and the bottom sides of the square run parallel to the x-axis.

7.6 Given a two-dimensional graph with points on it, find a line which passes the most number of points.

7.7 Design an algorithm to find the kth number such that the only prime factors are 3, 5, and 7.

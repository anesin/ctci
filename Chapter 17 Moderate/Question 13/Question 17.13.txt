17.13 Consider a simple node-like data structure called BiNode, which has pointers to two other nodes.
  1 public class BiNode {
  2   public BiNode node1, node2;
  3   public int data;
  4 }
The data structure BiNode could be used to represent both a binary tree (where node1 is the left node and node2 is the right node) or a doubly linked list (where node1 is the previous node and node2 is the next node). Implement a method to convert a binary search tree (implemented with BiNode) into a doubly linked list. The values should be kept in order and the operation should be performed in place (that is, on the original data structure).
